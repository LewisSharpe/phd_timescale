\section{Project Timeline:}
Due to numerous complications and delays in my study, a revised timeline until PhD completion has been compiled. The revised submission date for the PhD Thesis has been made for August 2021. You can see a progression diagram and a table schedule of new projected timeline below.
\subsection{Description of Project Phases:}
\colorbox{blue!30}{\textbf{Phase 1: Design of Minimax algorithm variants:}} \\
The first phase would design an Minimax algorithm with sequential and parallel variants, measure and compare the speed up achieved between them, then tuning algorithms to see if this speed up can be improved.  \\
\colorbox{green!30}{\textbf{Phase 2: Fitting Minimax into a larger game scenario:}} \\
The second phase would look to embed the above algorithm in larger logic game, and perform an experiment to observe how it performs with complexer decisions to make. \\
\colorbox{orange!30}{\textbf{Phase 3: Determining degree of Correlation between two factors:}} \\
The third phase will look to conduct experiment that would assess degree of correlation between 1) the increased performance of an AI search gained through parallelism (in Phase 2), and 2) a player's view of increased engagement in gameplay (assessed in Phase 3).  \\
\colorbox{gray!30}{\textbf{Phase 4: Write-up:}} \\
The final stage will be to write up and sum the whole research, and aim to cogent an argument to prove or disapprove a correlation between 1) the increased performance of an AI search gained through parallelism, and 2) a player's view of increased engagement in gameplay.
